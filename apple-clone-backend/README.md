# Apple Clone Backend

This is a guideline to download and test the backend. 

Currently backend only handles authorization (Create user, Log In user) 

I used CryptoJS for encryption and decryption of the password. Database holds decrypted version of the password.

## Steps to enable backend (make sure you are in the apple-clone/apple-clone-backend directory)
``` 
npm install
node index.js
```

Once backend is enabled you can sign in sign up to/from the website.
